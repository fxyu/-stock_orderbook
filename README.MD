# stock_orderbook

This project aims to show the order book of a particular stock of future in real-time. This project would like to practice the use of FUTU api to get the realtime tick data
and the order book information and display it into a web app.

`vueJS`, `TradingVue`, `socket.io` and `flask-socket.io` are used in this project as the front-end framework and the back-end framework.

Start the server by running the `app.py` in the server folder.
Start the web-client server by running the `npm run serve` using nodejs
